It features 1-minute intervals in which the first 30 seconds are completed in Zone 3, the next 20 seconds in Zone 4, and the last 10 second in Zone 5. You then go straight back to the top and complete the same sequence four times more for a total of five repetitions before easing down to Zone 1 for recovery.","duration":5400,"distance":0.0,"ftp":257,"lthr":173,"sportSettings":{"id":988718,"athlete_id":"i231285","types":["Ride","VirtualRide","MountainBikeRide","GravelRide","TrackRide"],"warmup_time":1200,"cooldown_time":600,"ftp":257,"power_zones":[56,76,91,106,121,150,999],"sweet_spot_min":84,"sweet_spot_max":97,"power_spike_threshold":30,"power_zone_names":["Active Recovery","Endurance","Tempo","Threshold","VO2 Max","Anaerobic","Neuromuscular"],"ftp_est_min_secs":300,"use_laps_for_power_intervals":false,"keep_all_laps_for_power_intervals":true,"lthr":173,"max_hr":193,"hr_zones":[139,154,162,172,177,182,193],"hr_zone_names":["Recovery","Aerobic","Tempo","SubThreshold","SuperThreshold","Aerobic Capacity","Anaerobic"],"hr_load_type":"HRSS","hrrc_min_percent":100.0,"gap_model":"NONE","elevation_correction":"NO","use_gap_zone_times":false,"pace_curve_start":100.0,"load_order":"POWER_HR_PACE","tiz_order":"POWER_HR_PACE","workout_order":"POWER_HR_PACE","interval_display":"POWER_HR_PACE","extract_workouts":false,"show_pauses":600,"ignore_velocity":false,"activity_field_ids":[],"activity_charts":{},"custom_field_ids":[],"custom_field_values":{},"custom_zones_ids":[],"other":false,"eFTPSupported":true,"use_distance_for_intervals":false},"target":"POWER","steps":[{"text":"Warm-up 1","duration":300,"power":{"start":72,"end":81,"units":"%ftp"},"_power":{"value":196.5,"start":185.0,"end":208.0}},{"text":"Warm-up 2","duration":900,"power":{"start":81,"end":90,"units":"%ftp"},"_power":{"value":219.5,"start":208.0,"end":231.0}},{"text":"5x","duration":300,"distance":0.0,"reps":5,"steps":[{"text":"Zone 3","duration":30,"power":{"start":95,"end":100,"units":"%ftp"},"_power":{"value":250.5,"start":244.0,"end":257.0}},{"text":"Zone 4","duration":20,"power":{"start":102,"end":105,"units":"%ftp"},"_power":{"value":265.5,"start":262.0,"end":269.0}},{"text":"Zone 5","duration":10,"power":{"start":105,"end":110,"units":"%ftp"},"_power":{"value":275.5,"start":269.0,"end":282.0}}]},{"text":"Recovery","duration":300,"power":{"start":72,"end":81,"units":"%ftp"},"_power":{"value":196.5,"start":185.0,"end":208.0}},{"text":"5x","duration":300,"distance":0.0,"reps":5,"steps":[{"text":"Zone 3","duration":30,"power":{"start":95,"end":100,"units":"%ftp"},"_power":{"value":250.5,"start":244.0,"end":257.0}},{"text":"Zone 4","duration":20,"power":{"start":102,"end":105,"units":"%ftp"},"_power":{"value":265.5,"start":262.0,"end":269.0}},{"text":"Zone 5","duration":10,"power":{"start":105,"end":110,"units":"%ftp"},"_power":{"value":275.5,"start":269.0,"end":282.0}}]},{"text":"Recovery","duration":300,"power":{"start":72,"end":81,"units":"%ftp"},"_power":{"value":196.5,"start":185.0,"end":208.0}},{"text":"5x","duration":300,"distance":0.0,"reps":5,"steps":[{"text":"Zone 3","duration":30,"power":{"start":95,"end":100,"units":"%ftp"},"_power":{"value":250.5,"start":244.0,"end":257.0}},{"text":"Zone 4","duration":20,"power":{"start":102,"end":105,"units":"%ftp"},"_power":{"value":265.5,"start":262.0,"end":269.0}},{"text":"Zone 5","duration":10,"power":{"start":105,"end":110,"units":"%ftp"},"_power":{"value":275.5,"start":269.0,"end":282.0}}]},{"text":"Recovery","duration":300,"power":{"start":72,"end":81,"units":"%ftp"},"_power":{"value":196.5,"start":185.0,"end":208.0}},{"text":"Cooldown","duration":2400,"power":{"start":81,"end":90,"units":"%ftp"},"_power":{"value":219.5,"start":208.0,"end":231.0}}],"zoneTimes":[{"id":"Z1","max":56,"name":"Z1","secs":0,"zone":1,"color":"#009e80","maxWatts":143,"minWatts":1,"percentRange":"0% - 56%"},{"id":"Z2","max":76,"name":"Z2","secs":0,"zone":2,"color":"#009e00","maxWatts":195,"minWatts":144,"percentRange":"57% - 76%"},{"id":"Z3","max":91,"name":"Z3","secs":4500,"zone":3,"color":"#ffcb0e","maxWatts":233,"minWatts":196,"percentRange":"77% - 91%"},{"id":"Z4","max":106,"name":"Z4","secs":750,"zone":4,"color":"#ff7f0e","maxWatts":272,"minWatts":234,"percentRange":"92% - 106%"},{"id":"Z5","max":121,"name":"Z5","secs":150,"zone":5,"color":"#dd0447","maxWatts":310,"minWatts":273,"percentRange":"107% - 121%"},{"id":"Z6","max":150,"name":"Z6","secs":0,"zone":6,"color":"#6633cc","maxWatts":385,"minWatts":311,"percentRange":"122% - 150%"},{"id":"Z7","max":999,"name":"Z7","secs":0,"zone":7,"color":"#504861","maxWatts":9999,"minWatts":386,"percentRange":"151% +"},{"id":"SS","gap":true,"max":97,"min":84,"name":"Sweet Spot","secs":3300,"zone":8,"color":"#ffa00e","maxWatts":249,"minWatts":215,"percentRange":"84% - 97%"}],"options":{},"locales":[]}
