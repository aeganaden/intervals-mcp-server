While VO2max is only one component an athlete's success, it is a direct predictor of endurance performance. Additionally, VO2 intervals have been proven to be more effective at improving overall economy than submaximal (threshold) or supramaximal intervals. Thus, a successful integration of these intervals in the General phase of training places the athlete in an advantageous position for the upcoming Specific phase, and ultimately their endurance performance results. These intervals are challenging, and the athlete must take great care to not perform them at a Zone 3 or Zone 5 intensity. The unusually high rest period compared to a Zone 3 work reflects the difficulty of the interval. The 80/20 principle is fundamental to executing these anaerobic intervals, as the athlete has deliberately trained easy 80% of the time in order to have the form necessary to maintain this repeated Zone 4 intensity. These anaerobic intervals are permission to go very hard. Be bold, but measured. A successful anaerobic interval set will have the athlete's output (pace, speed, power) be almost identical for each interval, in Zone 4, and without fade.",

The application of the cruise interval is broad. The only interval type appropriate for both the General and Specific phase of training, its benefit spans all triathlon distances. The 80/20 principle makes the cruise interval possible, by ensuring the athlete is sufficiently rested in order to achieve the required Zone 3 intensity. The cruise interval is the antithesis of Zone X. A successful cruise interval set has the output for each interval nearly identical to the previous, while maintaining solid Zone 3 intensity. Consider reducing the rest time from 3 minutes to 2 minutes and then 2 minutes to 1 minute if previous cruise intervals sets have been successful.",

If hills are unavailable, the athlete can simulate by reducing cadence to 65-75rpm and occasionally standing.",

Physically, they offer all the benefits of a regular Endurance Run, developing the basic physiological and psychological ingredients of endurance, including fat-burning capacity and mental focus. But the fast-finish element confers an additional benefit in the form of pacing skill development. Runners who struggle with pacing tend to pace their longer runs in such a way that they are tired and slowing down toward the end. Fast Finish Endurance Runs encourage you to hold back a little more in the early part of the run so you're able to speed up slightly at the end.",

While VO2max is only one component an athlete's success, it is a direct predictor of endurance performance. Additionally, VO2 intervals have been proven to be more effective at improving overall economy than submaximal (threshold) or supramaximal intervals. Thus, a successful integration of these intervals in the General phase of training places the athlete in an advantageous position for the upcoming Specific phase, and ultimately their endurance performance results. These intervals are challenging, and the athlete must take great care to not perform them at a Zone 3 or Zone 5 intensity. The unusually high rest period compared to a Zone 3 work reflects the difficulty of the interval. The 80/20 principle is fundamental to executing these anaerobic intervals, as the athlete has deliberately trained easy 80% of the time in order to have the form necessary to maintain this repeated Zone 4 intensity. These anaerobic intervals are permission to go very hard. Be bold, but measured. A successful anaerobic interval set will have the athlete's output (pace, speed, power) be almost identical for each interval, in Zone 4, and without fade.",

This workout is an excellent time to go very hard, but aim to have each interval with a similar output and avoid fading near the end of the interval. If hills are unavailable, a treadmill is recommended. If neither option is available, the prescribed intensity and duration can still be met.",
