{"description":"10 minutes Z1, 10 minutes Z2, 6 x (2.5 minutes Z4/5 minutes Z1) 80 minutes Z2, 5 minutes Z1\n`- - - -\nWhen executed properly, this anaerobic interval set is the most effective method at increasing an athlete's VO2max. While VO2max is only one component an athlete's success, it is a direct predictor of endurance performance. Additionally, VO2 intervals have been proven to be more effective at improving overall economy than submaximal (threshold) or supramaximal intervals. Thus, a successful integration of these intervals in the General phase of training places the athlete in an advantageous position for the upcoming Specific phase, and ultimately their endurance performance results. These intervals are challenging, and the athlete must take great care to not perform them at a Zone 3 or Zone 5 intensity. The unusually high rest period compared to a Zone 3 work reflects the difficulty of the interval. The 80/20 principle is fundamental to executing these anaerobic intervals, as the athlete has deliberately trained easy 80% of the time in order to have the form necessary to maintain this repeated Zone 4 intensity. These anaerobic intervals are permission to go very hard. Be bold, but measured. A successful anaerobic interval set will have the athlete's output (pace, speed, power) be almost identical for each interval, in Zone 4, and without fade.","duration":9000,"distance":0.0,"ftp":257,"lthr":173,"sportSettings":{"id":988718,"athlete_id":"i231285","types":["Ride","VirtualRide","MountainBikeRide","GravelRide","TrackRide"],"warmup_time":1200,"cooldown_time":600,"ftp":257,"power_zones":[56,76,91,106,121,150,999],"sweet_spot_min":84,"sweet_spot_max":97,"power_spike_threshold":30,"power_zone_names":["Active Recovery","Endurance","Tempo","Threshold","VO2 Max","Anaerobic","Neuromuscular"],"ftp_est_min_secs":300,"use_laps_for_power_intervals":false,"keep_all_laps_for_power_intervals":true,"lthr":173,"max_hr":193,"hr_zones":[139,154,162,172,177,182,193],"hr_zone_names":["Recovery","Aerobic","Tempo","SubThreshold","SuperThreshold","Aerobic Capacity","Anaerobic"],"hr_load_type":"HRSS","hrrc_min_percent":100.0,"gap_model":"NONE","elevation_correction":"NO","use_gap_zone_times":false,"pace_curve_start":100.0,"load_order":"POWER_HR_PACE","tiz_order":"POWER_HR_PACE","workout_order":"POWER_HR_PACE","interval_display":"POWER_HR_PACE","extract_workouts":false,"show_pauses":600,"ignore_velocity":false,"activity_field_ids":[],"activity_charts":{},"custom_field_ids":[],"custom_field_values":{},"custom_zones_ids":[],"other":false,"eFTPSupported":true,"use_distance_for_intervals":false},"target":"POWER","steps":[{"text":"Warm up","duration":600,"power":{"start":50,"end":70,"units":"%ftp"},"_power":{"value":153.5,"start":128.0,"end":179.0}},{"text":"Warm up","duration":600,"power":{"start":70,"end":83,"units":"%ftp"},"_power":{"value":196.0,"start":179.0,"end":213.0}},{"text":"6x","duration":2700,"distance":0.0,"reps":6,"steps":[{"text":"Hard","duration":150,"power":{"start":102,"end":110,"units":"%ftp"},"_power":{"value":272.0,"start":262.0,"end":282.0}},{"text":"Easy","duration":300,"power":{"start":50,"end":70,"units":"%ftp"},"_power":{"value":153.5,"start":128.0,"end":179.0}}]},{"text":"Active","duration":4800,"power":{"start":70,"end":83,"units":"%ftp"},"_power":{"value":196.0,"start":179.0,"end":213.0}},{"text":"Cool Down","duration":300,"power":{"start":50,"end":70,"units":"%ftp"},"_power":{"value":153.5,"start":128.0,"end":179.0}}],"zoneTimes":[{"id":"Z1","max":56,"name":"Z1","secs":0,"zone":1,"color":"#009e80","maxWatts":143,"minWatts":1,"percentRange":"0% - 56%"},{"id":"Z2","max":76,"name":"Z2","secs":2700,"zone":2,"color":"#009e00","maxWatts":195,"minWatts":144,"percentRange":"57% - 76%"},{"id":"Z3","max":91,"name":"Z3","secs":5400,"zone":3,"color":"#ffcb0e","maxWatts":233,"minWatts":196,"percentRange":"77% - 91%"},{"id":"Z4","max":106,"name":"Z4","secs":900,"zone":4,"color":"#ff7f0e","maxWatts":272,"minWatts":234,"percentRange":"92% - 106%"},{"id":"Z5","max":121,"name":"Z5","secs":0,"zone":5,"color":"#dd0447","maxWatts":310,"minWatts":273,"percentRange":"107% - 121%"},{"id":"Z6","max":150,"name":"Z6","secs":0,"zone":6,"color":"#6633cc","maxWatts":385,"minWatts":311,"percentRange":"122% - 150%"},{"id":"Z7","max":999,"name":"Z7","secs":0,"zone":7,"color":"#504861","maxWatts":9999,"minWatts":386,"percentRange":"151% +"},{"id":"SS","gap":true,"max":97,"min":84,"name":"Sweet Spot","secs":0,"zone":8,"color":"#ffa00e","maxWatts":249,"minWatts":215,"percentRange":"84% - 97%"}],"options":{},"locales":[]}
