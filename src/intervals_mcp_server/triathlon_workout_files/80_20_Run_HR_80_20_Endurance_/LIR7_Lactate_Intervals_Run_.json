This particular format was developed by exercise scientists at Inland Norway University as a way to increase the amount of time an athlete is able to spend near VO2max intensity within a single session without becoming exhausted.","duration":3180,"distance":0.0,"lthr":177,"threshold_pace":3.4364262,"pace_units":"MINS_KM","sportSettings":{"id":988719,"athlete_id":"i231285","types":["Run","VirtualRun","TrailRun"],"warmup_time":300,"cooldown_time":300,"power_spike_threshold":30,"ftp_est_min_secs":300,"use_laps_for_power_intervals":false,"keep_all_laps_for_power_intervals":true,"lthr":177,"max_hr":193,"hr_zones":[149,158,167,176,181,186,193],"hr_zone_names":["Recovery","Aerobic","Tempo","SubThreshold","SuperThreshold","Aerobic Capacity","Anaerobic"],"hr_load_type":"HRSS","hrrc_min_percent":100.0,"threshold_pace":3.4364262,"pace_units":"MINS_KM","pace_zones":[77.5,87.7,94.3,100.0,103.4,111.5,999.0],"pace_zone_names":["Zone 1","Zone 2","Zone 3","Zone 4","Zone 5a","Zone 5b","Zone 5c"],"pace_load_type":"RUN","gap_model":"STRAVA_RUN","elevation_correction":"AUTO","use_gap_zone_times":true,"best_effort_distances":[400.0,800.0,1500.0,1609.34,3000.0,5000.0,10000.0,21097.5,42195.0],"pace_curve_start":1000.0,"load_order":"POWER_PACE_HR","tiz_order":"POWER_HR_PACE","workout_order":"POWER_HR_PACE","interval_display":"POWER_HR_PACE","extract_workouts":false,"show_pauses":600,"ignore_velocity":false,"activity_field_ids":[],"activity_charts":{},"custom_field_ids":[],"custom_field_values":{},"custom_zones_ids":[],"other":false,"eFTPSupported":false,"use_distance_for_intervals":false},"target":"HR","steps":[{"text":"Warm-up 1","duration":300,"hr":{"start":72,"end":81,"units":"%lthr"},"_hr":{"value":135.0,"start":127.0,"end":143.0}},{"text":"Warm-up 2","duration":300,"hr":{"start":81,"end":90,"units":"%lthr"},"_hr":{"value":151.0,"start":143.0,"end":159.0}},{"text":"12x","duration":540,"distance":0.0,"reps":12,"steps":[{"text":"Hard","duration":30,"hr":{"start":102,"end":105,"units":"%lthr"},"_hr":{"value":182.5,"start":180.0,"end":185.0}},{"text":"Easy","duration":15,"hr":{"start":72,"end":81,"units":"%lthr"},"_hr":{"value":135.0,"start":127.0,"end":143.0}}]},{"text":"Recovery","duration":180,"hr":{"start":72,"end":81,"units":"%lthr"},"_hr":{"value":135.0,"start":127.0,"end":143.0}},{"text":"12x","duration":540,"distance":0.0,"reps":12,"steps":[{"text":"Hard","duration":30,"hr":{"start":102,"end":105,"units":"%lthr"},"_hr":{"value":182.5,"start":180.0,"end":185.0}},{"text":"Easy","duration":15,"hr":{"start":72,"end":81,"units":"%lthr"},"_hr":{"value":135.0,"start":127.0,"end":143.0}}]},{"text":"Recovery","duration":180,"hr":{"start":72,"end":81,"units":"%lthr"},"_hr":{"value":135.0,"start":127.0,"end":143.0}},{"text":"12x","duration":540,"distance":0.0,"reps":12,"steps":[{"text":"Hard","duration":30,"hr":{"start":102,"end":105,"units":"%lthr"},"_hr":{"value":182.5,"start":180.0,"end":185.0}},{"text":"Easy","duration":15,"hr":{"start":72,"end":81,"units":"%lthr"},"_hr":{"value":135.0,"start":127.0,"end":143.0}}]},{"text":"Cooldown","duration":600,"hr":{"start":72,"end":81,"units":"%lthr"},"_hr":{"value":135.0,"start":127.0,"end":143.0}}],"zoneTimes":[{"id":"Z1","secs":1800},{"id":"Z2","secs":300},{"id":"Z3","secs":0},{"id":"Z4","secs":0},{"id":"Z5","secs":0},{"id":"Z6","secs":1080},{"id":"Z7","secs":0}],"options":{},"locales":[]}
