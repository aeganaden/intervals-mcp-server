The application of the cruise interval is broad. The only interval type appropriate for both the General and Specific phase of training, its benefit spans all endurance event distances. The 80/20 principle makes the cruise interval possible, by ensuring the athlete is sufficiently rested in order to achieve the required Zone 3 intensity. The cruise interval is the antithesis of Zone X. A successful cruise interval set has the output for each interval nearly identical to the previous, while maintaining solid Zone 3 intensity. Consider reducing the rest time from 3 minutes to 2 minutes and then 2 minutes to 1 minute if previous cruise intervals sets have been successful.","duration":4320,"distance":12728.866,"lthr":177,"threshold_pace":3.4364262,"pace_units":"MINS_KM","sportSettings":{"id":988719,"athlete_id":"i231285","types":["Run","VirtualRun","TrailRun"],"warmup_time":300,"cooldown_time":300,"power_spike_threshold":30,"ftp_est_min_secs":300,"use_laps_for_power_intervals":false,"keep_all_laps_for_power_intervals":true,"lthr":177,"max_hr":193,"hr_zones":[149,158,167,176,181,186,193],"hr_zone_names":["Recovery","Aerobic","Tempo","SubThreshold","SuperThreshold","Aerobic Capacity","Anaerobic"],"hr_load_type":"HRSS","hrrc_min_percent":100.0,"threshold_pace":3.4364262,"pace_units":"MINS_KM","pace_zones":[77.5,87.7,94.3,100.0,103.4,111.5,999.0],"pace_zone_names":["Zone 1","Zone 2","Zone 3","Zone 4","Zone 5a","Zone 5b","Zone 5c"],"pace_load_type":"RUN","gap_model":"STRAVA_RUN","elevation_correction":"AUTO","use_gap_zone_times":true,"best_effort_distances":[400.0,800.0,1500.0,1609.34,3000.0,5000.0,10000.0,21097.5,42195.0],"pace_curve_start":1000.0,"load_order":"POWER_PACE_HR","tiz_order":"POWER_HR_PACE","workout_order":"POWER_HR_PACE","interval_display":"POWER_HR_PACE","extract_workouts":false,"show_pauses":600,"ignore_velocity":false,"activity_field_ids":[],"activity_charts":{},"custom_field_ids":[],"custom_field_values":{},"custom_zones_ids":[],"other":false,"eFTPSupported":false,"use_distance_for_intervals":false},"target":"PACE","steps":[{"text":"Warm up","duration":300,"pace":{"start":60,"end":76,"units":"%pace"},"_pace":{"value":2.3367698192596436,"start":2.0618557929992676,"end":2.6116838455200195},"_distance":701.03094},{"text":"Warm up","duration":300,"pace":{"value":82,"units":"%pace"},"_pace":{"value":2.8178694248199463,"start":2.7474226891994475,"end":2.888316160440445},"_distance":845.36084},{"text":"4x","duration":3120,"distance":9641.237,"reps":4,"steps":[{"text":"Hard","duration":600,"pace":{"start":93,"end":100,"units":"%pace"},"_pace":{"value":3.316151261329651,"start":3.195876359939575,"end":3.4364261627197266},"_distance":1989.6908},{"text":"Easy","duration":180,"pace":{"start":60,"end":76,"units":"%pace"},"_pace":{"value":2.3367698192596436,"start":2.0618557929992676,"end":2.6116838455200195},"_distance":420.61856}]},{"text":"Cool Down","duration":300,"pace":{"start":76,"end":87,"units":"%pace"},"_pace":{"value":2.800687313079834,"start":2.6116838455200195,"end":2.9896907806396484},"_distance":840.2062},{"text":"Cool Down","duration":300,"pace":{"start":60,"end":76,"units":"%pace"},"_pace":{"value":2.3367698192596436,"start":2.0618557929992676,"end":2.6116838455200195},"_distance":701.03094}],"zoneTimes":[{"id":"Z1","secs":1320},{"id":"Z2","secs":600},{"id":"Z3","secs":0},{"id":"Z4","secs":2400},{"id":"Z5","secs":0},{"id":"Z6","secs":0},{"id":"Z7","secs":0}],"options":{},"locales":[]}
